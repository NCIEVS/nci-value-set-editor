Welcome to the nci-value-set-editor Project!
==============================

EVS Value Set Editor provides a means for users to extract subsets of the universe of concepts comprised 
of all terminologies hosted by NCICBâ€™s terminology server. 

The key capabilities of EVS Value Set Editor include the following:
* Create a new value set (i.e., LexEVS value set definition) from scratch.
*	Clone (i.e., make a copy) of a value set based on an existing one available on the server.
*	Create and maintain metadata of a value set.
*	Construct component value sets. A component value set may be composed of a collection of concepts in a particular terminology, or a subset of concepts in a terminology sharing the same property value according to a user specified matching algorithm, or a subset of concepts in a terminology sharing the same relationship with a focus concept according to a user specified matching algorithm, or the entire set of concepts in a given terminology, or an existing value set on the server
*	Define a value set by an expression using value set components as the operands and set union, set interception, and set difference as binary operators.
*	Resolve the value set definition constructed above.
*	Export the value set definition to a file in LexGrid XML format.  Such files can be reviewed and published through the terminology server
